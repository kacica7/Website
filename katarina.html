          My name is Katarina and I am currently a first year student at the
          University of Belgrade. I study Mathematics and Computer Science at

            >the Faculty of Mathematics</a
          >. I am 20 years old and I was born in Bijeljina, Bosnia and
          Herzegovina (pictured down below in the Media section) but I currently
          live in Belgrade. I love to paint, draw and design on my iPad and make
          (and drink) coffee. I also like to tutor math and sometimes physics
          (though I have gotten very bad at physics) when I have time, as a way
          to earn some extra money :)

        <p class="paragraph">
          As of now, there might not be many projects, due to my primary focus
          being university. However, I take pride in the few things that I have
          created and have taken part of.

      <h4 class="listright">Hangman</h4>

      <p class="paragraph">
        This hangman game was a fun little project to work on in order to renew
        my C knowledge and take a break from uni problems. Check out hangman.c
        in my Finished-Projects repo on GitHub to check out the code and play
        the game! The gameplay is fairly simple, since I mainly focused on the
        loop, but I wanted to code it so that the the word that needs to be
        guessed is taken from a text file.

      <h4 class="listright">This website</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">
        This website is very dear to my heart since HTML and CSS was the first
        thing "code related" that I have learnt when I was 12. The website is
        hosted for free using Cloudflare.
      </p>
      <h4 class="listright">Design work</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">
        As I have mentioned above, I am also very passionate about art and
        design. I have designed T-Shirt and badge designs for a non-profit
        organisation that organises science camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina
        called Naucno drustvo "Vladimir Prelog". You can check some of my
        designs out in the Media section. I use a mix of Procreate and Affinity
        Designer 2.
